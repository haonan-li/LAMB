I want something in a central area (close to most/all major tourist areas), safe enough to walk around in the area in evenings and family friendly. A 3 or 4 star hotel is what I would prefer. I'm not too picky about hotels, I just prefer something clean (who doesn't). Thanks for your input!",

To be clear, we're not going to be an obvious stag party, with matching tshirts with stupid nicknames on our backs and over the top rowdy behavior etc, we're just a group of mid 30s blokes who like their beer hoping to take in as many good Dublin pubs as poss over our 2 night stay. Obviously we'll gravitate towards temple bar at some point no doubt, but we'll also want to explore the many other good pubs in the surrounding areas, so I guess my main question is does anyone know if we will have issues getting in to places and thus need to consider splitting into smaller groups whenever we move around?

    "question": "Have any families out there had any luck finding hotel accomodations in Buenos Aires that allow the kids to stay in the room with you. We're a family of 4 and would like to save money by booking a single room with 2 double bed instead of 2 separate rooms. So far I haven't had any luck findng one. Even the hotels the guides books rate as family friendly don't allow more than 3 people in a room. Renting 2 rooms per night will double our costs and make this a very expensive holiday. We do plan on renting an apartment for most of our stay. However there are several single nights that we need 1 night accomodation as we plan to come and go from Buenos Aires to other destinations. Being from Canada where we never have a problem booking a room for a family of 4 (usually at no additional cost) I'm having a real hard time getting my head around the idea of having to book 2 rooms for a night. Oddly enough we aren't having this same problem in Uruguay!",
