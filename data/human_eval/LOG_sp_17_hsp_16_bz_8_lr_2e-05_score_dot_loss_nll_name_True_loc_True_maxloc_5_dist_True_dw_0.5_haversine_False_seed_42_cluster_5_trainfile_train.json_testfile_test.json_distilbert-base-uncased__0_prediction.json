[{"question": "Hi, everyone! We (I and my wife) will be seeing Les Mis\u00e9rables at Queens Theatre in London. As the play ends around at 22:00 (it's so late!), we are planning to have dinner before the show. We have to arrive at the theatre by 19:00. What restaurants do you recommend? We would like to have dinner near Queens Theatre. The budget is about \uffe120-30 per person. We're looking forward to your kind and useful suggestions. P. S. Is it dangerous to walk around Queen's theatre after the show? In fact, we are living in Japan, which is a very secure country. We are not sure whether London is a safe city.

I was just reading about Sunday Roast which is something my husband would love! During high school he worked in a local restaurant that served Yorkshire Pudding so it would be a kick to have the real deal. Is there a way to work this in with our current plan and if so where do you suggest? I appreciate your opinions and am truly excited for our visit. We will be in London for 5 days so this is our only Sunday.

We arrive on Virgin Atlantic (Terminal 3) from the States & leave on Jet airways (Terminal 4) for Mumbai. We are a couple with 2 daughters (9 & 13). We were thinking of using that time to do a HOHO tour. Taking Heathrow Express from airport to Paddington and then a HOHO tour. But looks like it Paddington is not near any HOHO stop. Should we take the underground instead? Which tour is recommended? Big Bus or Original Tour? I think realistically, we will heading out of the airport around 12pm and should be back at Heathrow by at least 6 pm. What sights should we get off at? We want to see the guard change at palace if possible. thank you.

Recommendations of good red wine (we're both very unfamiliar with Italian wines) General sights in Rome, and general costs of these places :) And finally, where we can get some authentic tasty Italian Pizza, again, preferably near to where we are staying. If there are any good plays or operas playing during the 20th-27th, where these are and general costings? What the nightlife is like for a young couple? Possibly recommend a good wine bar?

I'm wondering if the forum has any recommendations as to which restaurants should be tried during our 4 day visit? There are 5 of us, and as parents, we're footing the bill, so I'm also looking for some places that would allow us to stay in our budget of $15. 00-20. 00 pp. We will be staying near H street, about 1 mile from Union Station.

I've had a look at veggie places but most seem a bit on the worthy side (I could be wrong, just a hunch) and am keener on places that are just good restaurants offering a reasonable amount of vegetarian dishes. So far, everything I've seen on the TA top 10 looks great, but all have only one vegetarian option so my partner and I would have to both order the same dish. This, for us, is usually a dealbreaker - but if there's anywhere really good that we shouldn't miss and if choice is limited anyway, we'd certainly make an exception.

What we would really like is somewhere to just relax on a couple of the nights rather than have to leave the hotel, so a roof terrace or outdoor space within a hotel would be great. Casual/relaxed atmosphere. Also nothing that is too $ for drinks. Yotel looks like it fits the bill, but it is a bit too far west for our liking. Pod 51 looks ok, rooms very small though.

I have no idea what to do that would be memorable. Desperately seeking advice. Please note: I'm NOT interested in dining or theater suggestions. Reason: I'm very fit and sit all day as it is. I'd be grateful if anyone has any cool ideas. Thank you!

Traveling w/ Mrs eephus this time instead of my teenage son, so no late night trips to the videogame arcade in Chinatown. We arrive on her birthday and I'm planning a romantic stroll somewhere followed by a late night dinner. I was thinking of Greenwich Village but heard reports of delayed construction in Washington Square. We'll be there late on a Sunday so I don't worry about workmen but if large sections of the park are torn up, I might look elsewhere. Is the park recognizable these days? If not, are there any other ideas for locations that are both romantic and iconic?", "answer_entity_id": "0_A_2983", "all_answer_entity_list": ["0_A_2983"], "tagged_latlongs": [[40.72856140136719, -74.00489044189453], [40.716461181640625, -73.99675750732422]], "prediction": ["0_A_3047", "0_A_3035", "0_A_3030", "0_A_3045", "0_A_3018", "0_A_3039", "0_A_2051", "0_A_3028", "0_A_2968", "0_A_2008", "0_A_3024", "0_A_2936", "0_A_3038", "0_A_3031", "0_A_3034", "0_A_2947", "0_A_3012", "0_A_3040", "0_A_3041", "0_A_2964", "0_A_2893", "0_A_2987", "0_A_3001", "0_A_2994", "0_A_2993", "0_A_3044", "0_A_2862", "0_A_3006", "0_A_2957", "0_A_2976"]}, {"question": "Hi Folks, Spending 3 days in London from April 5th until 8th and I was looking for some suggestions for good places to eat or go out for a few drinks? Nothing overly expensive but I'm not on a low budget either we are staying in the Park Plaza Westminster but don't mind having to travel a bit. Also we are going to see Wicked on one of the nights so if you could recommend somewhere nice to eat before the show that is near to the theatre I would appreciate it. As for bar suggestions I love both traditional and modern!
